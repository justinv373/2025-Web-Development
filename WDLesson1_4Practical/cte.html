      <p>A Computer Programming and Web Design Career and Technical Education (CTE) program prepares students for in-demand careers in technology by providing hands-on training in both front-end and back-end development. Students learn fundamental coding languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with design principles focused on usability and user experience. Through project-based learning, students build a portfolio of work that demonstrates their creativity and problem-solving skills, which may include designing websites, developing applications, and creating multimedia content.</p>
