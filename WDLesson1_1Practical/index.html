    <!-- Challenge 1: Change the title of the page to Web Technologies -->
    <title>Web Technologies</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Challenge 2: Create a heading, h1 for Web Technologies -->
    <h1>Web Technologies</h1>
    
    <!-- Challenge 3: Create a heading, h3 for HTML -->
     <h3>HTML</h3>

    <!-- Challenge 4: Create a paragraph explaining what is HTML. At least 3 sentences. -->
    <p>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language used to create and structure content on the World Wide Web. It uses a system of "tags"<br> to define elements like headings, paragraphs, images, and links, dictating how a web browser should display these components. Essentially, HTML provides the<br> foundational structure and meaning for all web pages, forming the backbone of what users see online.</p>

    <!-- Challenge 4a: Insert a horizontal rule, hr -->
    <hr>
    
    <!-- Challenge 5: Create a heading, h3 for CSS -->
    <h3>CSS</h3>

    <!-- Challenge 6: Create a paragraph explaining what is CSS.  At least 3 sentences. -->
    <p>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML. It allows<br>web developers to control the visual appearance of web pages, including elements such as layout, colors, fonts, and responsiveness across different devices.</p>
    <!-- Challenge 6a: Insert a horizontal rule, hr -->
     <hr>
    
    <!-- Challenge 7: Create a heading, h3 for JavaScript -->
    <h3>JavaScript</h3>
    <!-- Challenge 8: Create a paragraph explaining what is JavaScript.  At least 3 sentences. -->
    <p>JavaScript is a programming language used primarily to add interactive behavior to web pages. It works alongside HTML and CSS, which handles a website's<br> structure and appearance, by allowing developers to create animations, validate forms, and update content in real time.</p>
    <!-- Challenge 8a: Insert a horizontal rule, hr -->
    <hr>
    
    <!-- Challenge Bonus: Similar to the concepts above add one more web technology using a heading and paragraph.  Here are some suggestions of concepts: JQuery, Bootstrap, AFrame -->
